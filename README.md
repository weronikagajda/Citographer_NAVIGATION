# Citographer_NAVIGATION
Blender Addon: Extended Mapping Tool for Camera Navigation 

Cito-Navigation is a Blender add-on developed as part of the Citographer toolkit, focusing on enhancing spatial navigation and analysis within our environments using tempo-spatial modeling. Designed to work alongside the Citography toolset, this add-on allows to simulate navigation paths, visualize movement patterns, and explore dynamic spatial interactions in a virtual environment.

The add-on serves as a creative tool for users to experiment with navigation data, encouraging a reexamination of how paths, movement, and navigation shape our understanding of space. By offering tools for creating navigational setups, it opens possibilities for investigating spatial experiences, whether they be practical, artistic, or analytical.

This navigation tool is a key component of my 'Citography' PhD research. My work explores the intersections of digital technology, spatial environments, and the experiences of citizen interactions with our environmen.
